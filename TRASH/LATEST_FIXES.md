### üè∑Ô∏è Screenshot Trigger Labeling Fix

**Files Modified:** `scraper.js`, `public/index.html`

#### Problem Fixed:

- Screenshots were not showing correct trigger type (Manual vs Automatic)
- `triggerType` field was not being saved to database

#### Solution Applied:

1. **Backend (scraper.js):**

   - Added `triggerType: triggerType` to screenshot metadata before saving to MongoDB
   - Now properly stores 'manual' or 'automatic' based on how scraping was triggered

2. **Frontend (public/index.html):**
   - Updated display logic to show "Manual" vs "Automatic" (instead of "Auto")
   - Applied proper styling: Manual = orange (#f39c12), Automatic = green (#28a745)

#### Result:

- Screenshots table now accurately shows whether each screenshot was taken manually or automatically
- Clear visual distinction with appropriate colors

### üìÖ Date and "Viewed" Column Fixes

**Files Modified:** `scraper.js`

#### Problem Fixed:

- The "Viewed X ago" information from LinkedIn was being overwritten
- Free viewers table showed "Unknown" for view time instead of "2 hours ago", etc.

#### Root Cause:

The scraper was extracting LinkedIn's "Viewed 2 hours ago" text into a `timestamp` field, but then immediately overwriting it with the current scraping time.

#### Solution Applied:

1. **Preserve LinkedIn's View Time:**

   ```javascript
   const viewerWithTimestamp = {
     ...viewer,
     viewedTime: viewer.timestamp, // Preserve the "Viewed X ago" info
     timestamp: new Date().toLocaleString("en-IN", {
       timeZone: "Asia/Kolkata",
     }),
     scraped_at: new Date(),
   };
   ```

2. **Data Structure Now:**
   - `viewedTime`: Contains "2 hours ago", "1 day ago", etc. (from LinkedIn)
   - `timestamp`: Contains when the data was scraped (for our records)
   - `scraped_at`: Database timestamp for sorting/filtering

#### Result:

- Free viewers table now properly displays "2 hours ago", "5 days ago", etc. in the "Viewed" column
- Date column shows when the scraping occurred
- All viewer data is properly preserved and displayed

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### Button Animation CSS:

```css
.btn-primary:hover {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #7c3aed 0%, #6d28d9 100%);
  border-color: #6d28d9;
  transform: scale(1.02);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 15px 0 rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.4);
}
```

#### Screenshot Trigger Storage:

```javascript
triggerType: triggerType; // 'manual' or 'automatic'
```

#### Viewer Time Preservation:

```javascript
viewedTime: viewer.timestamp, // "2 hours ago"
timestamp: new Date().toLocaleString("en-IN", { timeZone: "Asia/Kolkata" })
```
