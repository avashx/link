I had two control panels before, and it was confusing, so I combined them into one called "Scraping Controls." It has one section for automatic scraping and another for manual buttons. I also made it look cleaner with better layout and colors.

There was a bug where dates showed as "01/01/1970" because of bad timestamps. I fixed it by checking for invalid values and using a better fallback system. Now all dates show up correctly.

Everything is working fine now and looks much better.
